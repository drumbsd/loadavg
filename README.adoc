# Loadavg
Simple loadavg agent/server that produce a static HTML page on daily timeframe. 

[qanda]
What is LoadAvg?::
  Is a simple go program with agent and a html generator to produce a static HTML file of a normalized load average server group

What is needed to build?::
  * go-lang
  * git
  * A redis server reachable from both agent and parser component.
  
Where it works?::
  Has been tested on Linux,OpenBSD and FreeBSD. 

How it works?::
  Agent component send to redis server the normalized loadaverage calculated on 5 minutes timeframe.
  Parser component, that needs to be executed manually or by cron, fetch data from redis and produce a file called loadavg.html

# Examples
.Follow these steps:
.  Clone the repository
.  Enter this command to build both agent and parser component
[source,bash]
# go build loadavg_get.go
# go build loadavg_put.go
. Copy the loadavg_put binary on servers that you want to monitor
. Execute the binary: 
[source,bash]
# nohup ./loadavg_put -redis=foo.bar.com &

or, still better:
[source,bash]
# cp loadavg_put.service /lib/systemd/system
[source,bash]
# systemctl daemon-reload
[source,bash]
# systemctl enable loadavg_put.service
[source,bash]
# systemctl start loadavg_put.service

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to edit $REDIS variable inside loadavg_put.service before to start it.

. Run parser component to get data from redis and produce HTML.
[source,bash]
# ./loadavg_get -redis=foo.bar.com 
. Open loadavg.html file with your browser

.How to read data
A -1 with green background::
    Means that no data has been retrieved for that server in that particular timeframe
A >= 1 with red background::
    Means that normalized loadaverage is >=1, so all your core are currently busy.
A 0 with white background:: 
    Means that load average is between 0 and 1, so it's all ok.
